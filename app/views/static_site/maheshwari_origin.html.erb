	Though there is no particular book available on maheshwari samaj's  origing but most authentic work done on the origin of Maheshwaris is by  late Shri Shivkarnji Darak of Mundwa. Given below are the findings of  his research.King Khadgal Sen of Khandela was blessed with a son,  Sujankunwar, after a yagnya was performed.  The rishis (priests) who did t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>he yagnya warned the king that this son of  his should not be allowed to go East. When Sujankunwar grew he  inherited the kingdom. King Khadgal Sen himself&nbsp;retired. It was this  time when the growth of Jainism was in full swing. Sujankunwar also  baptised himself in Jainism and started opposing yagnyas.  Not heeding the advice of the priests he proceeded with his 72 Umraons  towards east. Seeing the priests performing yagnya Sujankunwar asked his  Umraons to disturb it. For this deed of theirs the priests made them  all in statues.  On hearing the news Khadgal Sen along with his queens killed themselves.  Wife of Sujankunwar Chandrawati, along with the wives of all the  Umraons went to the place where their husbands were made into statues.  They pleaded with the priests to reconvert their husbands to live form.  The priests showed their inability to take back the curse. They,  however, advised these women to pray with Lord Shiva and Parvatiji for  bringing these statues back to life  . Lord Shiva and Parvatiji were impressed by the prayers and gave life  to all the statues. They were also asked to leave their Kshatriya  tradition and convert to Vaisyas. The priests on whose curse the Umraons  were made into statues were Parashar (Pareek), Dadhichi (Dahiya),  Gautam (Gurjar Gaud), Khandik (Khandelwal), Sukumarg (Sukuwal) and  Sarsur (Sarswat). The priests asked the Lord as to how their yagnyas  would materialise and who will save them from the plunderers. The Lord  asked them that each of the six priests should take 12 Umraons as their  disciples and these Umraons will keep on giving you alms.   The descendent of these 72 Vaisya families will always be with you to  take care.&nbsp;From then these 72 families were called Maheshwaris taking  the name from Lord Mahesh or Lord Shiva. These 72 families with their  surnames (khaps) formed the primary Maheshwari list of surnames. Later  there were subdivisions and from amongst these 72 surnames there were  more sub-surnames (up-khaps). It was in this way that&nbsp;with the blessing  of Lord Mahesh the formation of Maheshwaris was done on the ninth day of  the Jaishtha month. Later 5 more families from the Kshatriyas joined  the Maheshwari.</span>

	<h3>History of Maheswari Samaj:-</h3>
</div>
<p > Raja Khandelsen was the ruler of Kahandelgram,Rajasthan,  IndiaRajasthan, India.He was blessed with two beautiful queens, Rani  Suryakuvar and Rani Indrakuvar. However,the king did not have any  children, thus no one to carry his name or kingdom. He performed many  pujas, yagnas and much charity to help the poor, but no avail. Finally,  one day he shared his sorrow with his spiritual advisor, Maharishi  Yagyavalk. Maharishi Yagyavalk told him that he was cursed from his  previous life and this was the reason he was still childless.  Then the Maharishi explained to the king &quot;In your previous life, you  earned your living through killing and selling of animals flesh.  Once, you aimed your bow and arrow at a pregnant deer and killed her.As  she died in pain, she placed a curse upon you saying, &quot;You shall be  childless!&quot; However, you felt guilty from this act, and went to Pushkar  where you took bath in the pious pond, to wash off your sins. This  religious act helped you become a king in this life. To recover from  this past curse, there is one solution that I shall explain to you. Not  too far from here in Bhashkar state, there is a Pipal tree, under which a  Shivling is buried. You should get this Shivling out and make a  beautiful temple for Lord Shiva, in which this Shivling must be  embellished with respect and devotion.&quot; The king did exactly as he was  told, in addition he recited the &quot; Om, Namah Sivaya&quot; shloka for two  years. With this pious and religious act, Lord Shiva became happy and  the king was blessed with a son, whom he named Sujansen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the prince Sujansen was born, the spiritual advisor made  his Kundali, to chart out his graha and nakhshatra. He shared the graha  position findings with King Khandelsen and said &quot;Your son will be  handsome, masculine, and powerful; however due to an unforeseen incident  he will suffer from sorrow for a short while, but that will eventually  result in a happy ending.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Prince Sujansen was married to princess Chadravati, a  daughter of King Yudhaveer. After this marriage,the King Khandelsen  handed over the kingdom to his son Sujansen, and moved to the forest for  his retirement. One day King Sujansen went into the forest to hunt with  his seventy-two soldiers as part of his routine. As the King and his  soldiers were hunting, they got lost and became hungry. Soon, they  sensed an aroma, as if someone was cooking good food, and they followed  this aroma and reached a place where six rishis were performing yagna  for Lord Shiva.Due to extreme hunger, the king and soldiers started  eating prasad, drinking water from the nearby pond that was reserved for  the yagna puja, and also started washing their stained bows and arrows  in it. This broke the rishis' concentration, and they cursed king and  his seventy-two soldiers to turn into stones.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back in the kingdom, the queen and other 72 wives of soldiers  were waiting for their husbands to return for months, and finally Queen  The Prince Sujansen was married to princess Chadravati, a daughter of  King Yudhaveer. After this marriage,the King Khandelsen handed over the  kingdom to his son Sujansen, and moved to the forest for his retirement.  One day King Sujansen went into the forest to hunt with his seventy-two  soldiers as part of his routine. As the King and his soldiers were  hunting, they got lost and became hungry. Soon, they sensed an aroma, as  if someone was cooking good food, and they followed this aroma and  reached a place where six rishis were performing yagna for Lord  Shiva.Due to extreme hunger, the king and soldiers started eating  prasad, drinking water from the nearby pond that was reserved for the  yagna puja, and also started washing their stained bows and arrows in  it. This broke the rishis' concentration, and they cursed king and his  seventy-two soldiers to turn into stones. Chandravati went to see  Maharishi Jabali. The Rishi Jabali explained the situation in its  entirety and suggested that she and all other 72 wives of soldiers  should go to the temple near the pond and worship Lord Shiva for their  husbands' life.At this time, inKailashparvath, in the Himaliyas Lord  Shiva and his beautiful wife Parvati were residing. Lord Shiva told  Parvati that he needs to visit Earth, some of his worshipers were  performing ygana and he needs go and show his satisfaction towards the  successful completion of yagna. Parvati, loves her husband dearly, and  did not like to part from her husband. This time Parvati insisted that  she also goes with Shiva to Earth. Lord Shiva said to Parvati, &quot;Dear,  you are very kind hearted, you will not be able to bear the pains of the  people living on Earth. As always, you will ask me to take away all of  their sorrows, so it is better you stay here till my return to  Kailashparvath&quot;. Mata Parvati insisted and said, &quot;No, I must go with  you&quot;. After a while, Lord Shiva said, <b>&quot;As you wish!&quot;</b> and they both  started their journey to Earth where the rishis were performing the  yagna.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Lord Shiva and Mata Parvati, reached the site, Parvati Mata  saw the queen and all other wives were crying for their husbands' stone  figures. Lord Shiva explained the situation to Mata Parvati.Mata  immediately said to Lord Shiva &quot;You must give these husbands another  life, because when I can not live without you even for a fraction of a  second, how can you expect me to leave this place while these wives are  so sorrowful in life without their husbands.&quot; Lord Shiva said &quot;This is  what I was afraid of when you decided to join me for this journey; in  any case I must do so&quot;.  At this point, Lord Shiva brought king and other seventy-two soldiers  back to life, and told king Sujansen &quot;Because you have performed sinful  activities, taking away lives of God's creatures, and have misused your  power, you have suffered from this incident. From now on, since I am  giving all of you a second life, you will be known after my name  as&quot;Mahesh-waris&quot;. You will also stop your role of Kshatriya and play a  new role of Vaishya, Vaishya Dharam , which is a role of non-violence.  Sujansen to compensate for your violent tendency, from now on you will  make living through donations from your other seventy-two Vaishaya  brothers and you will perform the task of documenting their family  trees&quot;. At once, all came to life as if they were awakening from a long  sleep. However, they were hesitant to accept their wives, since they  still belonged to theKshatriya caste. At this point, Parvati Mata said,  &quot;All of you takefour parikramas around me, whoever are wife and husband;  their gathbandhan will be joined auto-magically&quot;. At this, everyone did  so, and they re-joined as husbands and wives. Due to this, four feras  (parikramas) are done outside, during the Maheshwari weddings, as a  reminder of our origin. Lord Shiva gave this blessing to the new  seventy-two Vaishyas on the 9 th day of Jyesth, Shukla Paksh in the year  9 of Yudhisthira Sanvat. On this day, newlywed brides and grooms are  appointed to do Lord Shiva and Mata Parvati's puja so that they can also  be blessed with children and live a happy and joyous life eternally.  While the seventy-two soldiers were bathing in the pond, their bows and  arrows were melted, and after this the pond was named &quot;Loh-Garl&quot;. Due to  the incident in this story, new seventy-two Maheshwari khanp (Last)  names were created. After this, additional five Kshatriya last names  were also added to the original seventy-two last names. Khandela town is  about 10 miles away from Phulera junction of Jaipur district. Loh-Garl  area still has a water bath, which is 20-25 miles away from the Ringus  junction, near the mountains. Birla, one of India's most prestigious  families has established a sanatorium near the Didwana of Nagour  distict.</p>
